list_of_shapes
==============
Created by Svetlana Durnovtseva. St. Petersburg, Russia, 2014.

Each Node of this double-linked List contains a copy of somehow earlier created Shape (Circle or Rect). 
General methods for a list are implemented (output/input from file, removing/adding nodes, sorting by square of shapes etc.)
